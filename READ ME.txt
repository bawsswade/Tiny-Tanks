Graph.h
******************
	- Creates a grid of nodes with each node connecting to the ones around it.
	- Can search, using different patterns, for a path from a start node to an end node.
	- Walls can be added so to be traversed around. 
	- Nodes connecting to each other can have different edge costs which effects 
		the selecting path.
	

//////////////////Graph/////////////////////////////////

	1. CONSTRUCTOR: create graph
	Graph(width of nodes, height of nodes)

	2. hardcoded walls that prevent walking
	SetWalls();

	3. use search function
	SearchDijkstra(Graphnode iterator start pointer, graphnode iterator end pointer)
	SearchAStar(Graphnode iterator start pointer, graphnode iterator end pointer)

	4. build the path
	BuildPath(Graphnode iterator start pointer, graphnode iterator end pointer)
